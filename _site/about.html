  	<section>
  		<p>I have quite the varied career background first starting in Graphic Design with Johnson &amp; Johnson Pharmaceuticals where I was constantly working with other departments to create visually appealing display ads for all of the main campuses.</p>

<p>My next job was in product development where I managed the life-cycle of products from idea to creation and worked with each department along the way to ensure a timely and cost effective process. While I was still working I was teaching myself to code on the side and started to do some freelance website building jobs to further learn.</p>

<p>My next job in web development at Contemporary Graphic Solutions. While here I used my newly acquired HTML, CSS &amp; Javascript skills to build small online portals for our customers to login and order customized print material. After hitting a ceiling for my skills I decided to dive head first into the world of programming by going to a coding bootcamp in NYC where I spent 12 hours a day for 3 months learning the in and outs of computer science fundamentals with a focus on Node and Javascript fullstack frameworks.</p>

<p>After my program I got my current as Frontend Engineer at ALOHA where I was able to use a bit of experience from all my past jobs to eventually become the Lead Frontend Engineer.</p>
